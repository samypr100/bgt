POV: you want a framework-agnostic way to reliably run a plain or async function or method in the background, continuously or with pauses between work units.

*bgt* comes to the rescue with:

- A **service** that runs your code in a loop and optionally waits between work units.
  It wakes up on a fixed time interval, or as soon as something wakes it.

- A **supervisor** that runs that loop in a **background thread**.
  If your code crashes, the supervisor restarts the loop after an exponential backoff.
  Write [crash-only](https://bgt.hynek.me/stable/glossary/#crash-only) code, *bgt* takes care of the rest.

- Thorough instrumentation via [*structlog*](https://www.structlog.org/) and [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io).

- Framework and platform independence.

*bgt* is the engine underneath [*pgbg*](https://pgbg.hynek.me/), which adds PostgreSQL `LISTEN` / `NOTIFY`-driven wakeups and leader election with automatic failover on top.
If your services should wake up on database events, or only one process at a time should do the work, check it out!

*bgt* is **not** a job queue like [Celery](https://docs.celeryq.dev/) or [RQ](https://python-rq.org).
Common use cases include:

- Periodic cleanup duties for expired caches or sessions.
- Flushing buffered metrics or events.
- Processing a continuous stream of data in bounded batches.

---

Here's a service that runs a work unit every two seconds and survives its own crashes:

```python
import bgt


def do_work() -> bool:
    ...  # one bounded work unit; if it crashes, it doesn't crash the loop

    return False  # False = wait for next wakeup; True = run again immediately


with bgt.SupervisedService.start(
    bgt.as_work_factory(do_work),
    name="example",
    wakeup=bgt.IntervalOnlyWakeup(),
    interval=2,
):
    ...  # do_work runs in the background until we leave this block
```

Return `True` from your work unit to be run again immediately.
This keeps work units short, which makes shutdowns prompt.
For async work units such as `async def do_work()` use `bgt.as_async_work_factory()` instead.
